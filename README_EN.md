## ✨ Key Features

### 🔐 Tiered-Permission Knowledge Base
An enterprise-grade knowledge hub designed for internal teams, integrating **knowledge storage**, **management**, **retrieval**, and **fine-grained access control** in one system. Ensures data security from both **user dimension** and **content dimension**.

- **🏗️ Core Support Layer**: Foundational system capabilities
- **☁️ Cloud LLM Module**: Provides semantic understanding and content generation for knowledge-based Q&A. Supports integration with cloud LLMs such as **Qwen**, **Deepseek**, and **Doubao**, with flexible **model switching** or **combination** based on business needs.

- **⚙️ Core Function Layer**: Core business logic and permission control
- **📚 Knowledge Base Management Module**: Handles document ingestion, processing, and storage to serve as the **data foundation** for Q&A.
- **🔌 External Data Integration Module**: Connects to external business systems to enrich knowledge sources; synchronizes real-time business data into the knowledge base via **MCP interfaces**.
- **🛡️ Admin Management Module (Central Control Point)**:
  - **Permission Management**: Enforces security from **user** and **content** perspectives. Supports granular access policies by **department**, **role**, **user tag**, or **content filter**. Permissions are set by the **uploader** or **authorized content owner**. Allows explicit configuration to **allow or deny specific users/departments from querying certain types of information**. **Critical attention must be paid to prevent information leakage via LLMs.**
  - **Document Upload**: Centralized upload interface in admin panel; also supports authorized users uploading documents via the frontend. All content automatically **inherits defined permission policies**.

- **💬 User Interaction Layer**: Direct user-facing interfaces
- **🖥️ User Portal**: Standard interface for end users. Offers **text-based Q&A** and supports **document upload** (subject to permission checks).
- **🎤 Voice Integration**: Provides **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** and **Speech-to-Text (ASR)** capabilities, extending knowledge base Q&A to **voice interaction scenarios**, suitable for meetings, customer service, mobile apps, etc.

### 🧠 Enterprise RAG Solution
- **Private Knowledge Base**: Built on **Langchain4j** framework + **BGE-large-h-v1.5** Chinese embedding model
- **Vector Database Support**: Compatible with **Milvus**, **Weaviate**, **Qdrant**
- **Data Privacy Guaranteed**: Supports **fully on-premise deployment** to protect enterprise data

### 🎨 Creative AI Tools
- **AI Art Generation**: Deep integration with **DALL·E-3**, **MidJourney**, **Stable Diffusion**
- **Smart PPT Creation**: One-click conversion of text into polished presentation slides

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### 🏗️ Core Framework
- **Backend**: **Spring Boot 3.4** + **Spring AI** + **Langchain4j**
- **Database**: **MySQL 8.0** + **Redis** + Vector Databases (**Milvus/Weaviate/Qdrant**)
- **Frontend**: **Vue 3** + **Vben Admin** + **Naive UI**
- **Authentication**: Dual protection with **Sa-Token** and **JWT**

### 🔧 System Components
- **File Processing**: Parsing of **PDF**, **Word**, **Excel**, plus intelligent image analysis
- **Real-Time Communication**: **WebSocket** for real-time interaction, **SSE** for streaming responses
- **System Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging, performance monitoring, and health checks

> 💡 **Tip**: This project is an enhanced version of **ruoyi-ai**, improving large model and **MCP** integration (the original ruoyi-ai had limitations). It **supports MCP calls for any database and any API**.
